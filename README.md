Learning introductory javascript by building a pyramid generator

JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that can be used to make web pages interactive. It's one of the core technologies of the web, along with HTML and CSS. All modern browsers support JavaScript.

In this practice project, I learned fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript by coding my own Pyramid Generator. I learned how to work with arrays, strings, functions, loops, if/else statements, and more practicing in https://www.freecodecamp.org/.
